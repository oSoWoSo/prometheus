---

An encrypted, next-generation filesystem that aims to protect from cryptoanalysis as well as 5$ wrench attacks.

Not licensed AGPLv3 yet as the project is still ongoing. Once the project reaches a stable base, we'll change the license.

## Features

_First off: Veracrypt is not a filesystem_

**Prometheus is unlike other filesystems based on publicy available research documents and tries to implement the measurements suggested in those.**

- Post-quantum secure encryption
- Invisible plausible deniability[^1]
- Cascade encryption
- Lightweight kernel module (few hundred lines) for increased performance
- Supports multiple volumes as well as decoy volumes
- Supports multiple users with a shared folder
- Proper ACL implementation
- File Consistency (fail-safe I/O operations)
- Error Correction
- Concurrency for non-sensitive Operations
- Encrypted Ressource Caching
